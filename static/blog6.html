                        It has been over a year since I have lived in the US now. Although for the last few months it has been kind of odd
                        with the pandemic. I lived in Japan back around 2000 so I tend to compare many things to that. When I went to Japan,
                        I thought everything would be different. Really, I was surprised how similar things were. With the US and Canada, I
                        figured things would be similar, I guess that is true. There are a few things that are different from my home in
                        Vancouver Canada, like the medical system and the VISA systems.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Why did I move to the US and the bay area? I feel like a lot of my friends in the US are thinking maybe they should
                        move to Canada or at least out of the bay area. I moved to the US for a chance to work on a new platform Google
                        Stadia. Before this I worked at Electronic Arts for around 20 years. Most of that was on FIFA soccer. I think in
                        Vancouver this is one of the best jobs to have. Most game teams don’t really know if their game will be successful
                        or not. FIFA has sold well for quite some time. From a technology point of view this meant there is always next
                        year. This made EA Sports fairly far sighted and tried to do good maintenance. But I did work there for a long time,
                        so I really did want to do something new.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        I have always heard that Google is a good company to work for. In Vancouver I didn’t have a chance to work for them.
                        Vancouver being close to Seattle and in the same time zone as Silicon Valley it has a lot of big tech companies like
                        Amazon and Microsoft, but there are no real Google offices. This Stadia thing seemed like a good fit for me. My
                        background in games and most games being developed on windows I could help Google understand the games industry
                        better. For me I thought it would be interesting to learn Linux, web technology, and the way Google did things. I
                        thought the job was worth at least interviewing for. It was hard to say if Stadia was going to really work both
                        technically and as a business, but I could use some chaos in my life after all of the stability I had on FIFA at EA.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        I didn’t really study that hard for the programming test. I wasn’t sure if I was really ready to move to the US. I
                        do think it’s a good idea to do interviews every once in a while, because then you learn what other companies are
                        going to look for when they are hiring.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        To tell the truth I thought I blew the phone interview. I tried to code in python and I write python like a C
                        programmer I made some dumb mistakes. If I would have just stuck to C++ I would have done fine. But they called me
                        back and flew me down there and I did pretty well for the in-person test. They made me an offer, but it was not
                        worth moving down for. Moving your life to some other place means you’re going to have to spend a lot of vacation
                        time flying back to see your parents or your wife’s parents. I know this well as my wife already has to fly
                        back-and-forth quite a bit with Japan. Although Covid19 has stopped me from traveling much at all. So, I gave a
                        counteroffer and didn't really know if they would accept or not. In the end they did and so I moved to Silicon
                        Valley.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        How did I find out about the job? There are a few ex-EA people I know on Stadia. I think one of my ex-coworkers
                        thought that I could help the Stadia team out and told some recruiters. Building a platform is different then
                        building games and obviously Stadia will build the platform out of technology that Google knows well like Linux,
                        virtualization and chrome. I don’t know these things so well yet but I do know how games work and I have ported
                        games to a lot of platforms so I can guess what a game developer might want and understand their problems. I think
                        it is a good trade for all involved.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        What do I think of Silicon Valley? Should you try and move here? Well there are interesting projects here that it
                        might be hard to do in other places. I don’t know if the pandemic will stop that or not. I have moved for work twice
                        in my life. It is an interesting opportunity. Visiting a country and living in another country are vastly different
                        things. There are many things to think about. VISA, Tax, Medical systems, housing costs and many more. I think you
                        need to be the type of person that can push through a bunch of pain in the butt problems like learning new
                        government systems. I can deal with some pain in the butt systems as I do things like memorizing kanjis on my free
                        time. With the US you will have to deal with a lot of bad defaults and not mind reading through a lot of small
                        print.
