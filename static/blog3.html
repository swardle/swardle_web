                    </header>
                    <p>This year I did my 2nd CPPCON presentation this last September. It was a topic that is getting more and more important, packages and modules but I will talk about that later. You can see my presentation <a href="presentation.html">here</a>.
                        For now it is January and most people have done their CPPCON write up months ago so lets do that first.
                        <p>
                            <p>My poor excuse for not writing about CPPCON sooner is, I was studying calculus at Langara college and it took a bit more time than I expected. Most people think I am relatively good at math, but most people also think I should
                                be good at English as I am a native speaker, little do they know. But this is also a topic for another time.</p>
                            <p>The reason to go to CPPCON, as everyone says, is the people. I’ll name-drop quite a few names here to help me remember everyone. (As I am not sure how many people will read this anyways. :)</p>
                            <p>Each time I go to CPPCON I always met Fedor Pikus, Ben Deane, Sean Middleditch, Nicolas Guillemot, and Michael Wong, and many others. If you go to CPPCON for a few years in a row you can meet a lot of your “twitter” friends
                                in real life. Once they know you they are much more likely to help you. This year I got to meet Matt Godbolt and Jason Turner for the first time. I listen to Rob Irving's and Jason Turner's and podcast CppCast as soon as
                                it comes out and use Matt’s tools so it is nice to talk to these guys. </p>
                            <p>In the it is a small world category, I met Charles Beattie and Ricardo Barreira currently at DeepMind. Ricardo worked on Mirror Edge and Charles knows Jason Sanmiya and Andy Younger (good friends of mine). We talked a lot about
                                the build and integration setup at Google and how most games companies work. Charles says he is also dyslexic like me.
                            </p>
                            <p>One of the good things about taking so long to write this is if I still remember the talk it was either very good or so bad that I still rememeber it. Mostly with the frostbite changes going on at work I have been thinking
                                about workflow and large scale code problems. I think you can see that in the presentations I rememeber.</p>
                            <h3>Build systems talks</h3>
                            <p><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9nH2vZ2mNo" target="_blank">Teresa Johnson “ThinLTO: Scalable and Incremental Link-Time Optimization”</a></b>
                                <br><br> This was one of the best talks of CPPCON 2017. She talked about link time code generation and how it works at Google. This helped answer one big question I have had for years. How come Google does not use unity
                                builds (AKA bulkbuilds or masterbuilds etc…). why don't they just include .cpp files until the compiler falls over. While I am still skeptical that ThinLTO is as good as unity builds for us at EA given the setup needed
                                but it could cover a lot of the problems I see.
                            </p>
                            <p><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7THzO-D0ta4" target="_blank">Isabella Muerte “There Will Be Build Systems: I Configure Your Milkshake”</a></b>
                                <br><br> Isabella and I share a lot of ideas on build systems. She was trying to tell me that cmake was much better then EA packages a few years back this was another motivation for my talk. I wonder if she will make her
                                own build system. I hope so.
                            </p>
                            <p><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8UoYG4dvH8" target="_blank">Dmitry Panin “Practical Techniques for Improving C++ Build Times”</a></b>
                                <br><br> Dmitry talks about the build setup at facebook. It is a little like the talk that Teresa at Google did on link time code gen at google but Teresa is more of a compiler/linker dev and Dmitry is more of a build system
                                guy so the point of view is different. I found out cool things like they don’t use unity builds as well and they make 2GB elf files in a few minutes of link time. This sounds like FIFA before unity builds.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Threading talks</h3>
                            <p><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQFzMfHIxng" target="_blank">Fedor Pikus “C++ atomics, from basic to advanced. What do they really do?”</a></b>
                                <br><br>
                                <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxQ5K9lo034">Fedor Pikus “Read, Copy, Update, then what? RCU for non-kernel programmers”</a></b>
                                <br><br> Fedor finally got me to understand RCU with these talks. Fedor is a good speaker and is fun to learn from.
                            </p>
                            <h3>C++ madness talks</h3>
                            <p><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJwd4JLYJJY" target="_blank">Ben Deane, and Jason Turner constexpr ALL the things.</a></b>
                                <br><br> I didn’t see this talk in real time but did watch it afterwords. I would ask why would anyone want a JSON parser at compile time, but I guess the answer is becasue it is awesome. Just don’t do this in production
                                :)
                            </p>
                            <h3>Large code base talks</h3>
                            <p><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2XtqVZcSdM" target="_blank">David Sankel “So, you inherited a large code base...”</a></b>
                                <br><br> David’s talk about working on a large code base. This talk has a great set of advice for all programmers. Neophilia is my favorite new word. Lack of follow though is a problem I have seen many times. He brings
                                up clang tools to help automate changes.
                            </p>
                            <p><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tISy7EJQPzI" target="_blank">Titus Winters “C++ as a "Live at Head" Language</a></b>
                                <br><br>I do like a lot of Titus's ideas even if I find them difficult to imagine at EA. I assume he has to say things very strongly to herd all of the cats at Google. But if I had fewer platforms, fewer configs, more teams
                                with more server and dev ops experience, more compiler experts and 10x lines of code, I think his ideas become a good if not great solution.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Specific application talks</h3>
                            <p><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdPeXJ0eiGc" target="_blank">Nicolas Guillemot “Design Patterns for Low-Level Real-Time Rendering”</a></b>
                                <br><br> Nicolas gave an overview of low-level GPU programming. This is a hard subject to cover in 1 hour. I did take a way a few things to look up after.
                            </p>
                            <p><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9tGa-hbmTU" target="_blank">Alan Bucior “Building Better Worlds: Developing a Procedural City Tool for Alien...”</a></b>
                                <br><br> Alan didn’t go into too much detail as his talk was only 30min but does show how C++ is used on movies. You can start to get a feel for what it might be like to work on a large movie project from watching this.
                            </p>
                            <p><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AMhgkLjVHM" target="_blank">Billy Baker “Almost Unlimited Modern C++ in Kernel-Mode Applications”</a></b>
                                <br><br> Billy talked about working with real time windows OS. This reminded me of working on console with odd OSs. This is a good talk if you want to understand some of the problems you have with large embedded work like
                                airplane sims.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Tools and other C++ thing</h3>
                            <p><b><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/cppcast/id968703120?mt=2" target="_blank">Rob Irving’s and Jason Turner’s CppCast

</a></b>
                                <br><br> If you have gone to CPPCON and liked the lunchtime conversations then maybe you would like this podcasts. They bring on a lot of the leading lights of C++ on and you get to see the people and some of their ideas.
                            </p>
                            <p><b><a href="https://godbolt.org/" target="_blank">Matt Godbolt’s Compiler Explorer - C++</a></b>
                                <br><br> Since I was giving links I guess I should give out compiler explorer link.
