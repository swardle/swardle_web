                    <p> This first blog post is about me and my start in programming. I have never been one to write a lot. Those who know me know why I am very dyslexic so it takes a long time. But my wife Seiko is learning web design so I figured I could
                        help by learning some Javascript by writing some games. I will go into these things on different days. </p>
                    <p>Watching people learn to code is very interesting to me. When I first learned to code I didn't understand anything that was going on. I was lucky, I did like a lot of programmer around my age did I copy programs that was written from
                        magazine. But I didn't understand these at all. When I started programming I remember not understanding how a function call could work. How could it? There are no line numbers like basic and it’s "goto 10" how could a computer
                        work. It would not read the whole file search to find the function name then call the function, could it? This seemed way too slow. </p>
                    <p>Then one day it clicked. I started learning ASM and C++ at the same time. I had classes in but didn't learn C and Pascal before. Almost one year of programming and nothing was sinking in. Then one day it was like oh.... it is not based
                        on line numbers but bytes. There is still goto 10 but it is goto byte 0x1234. After this C++ just made sense I was suddenly quite good at it where I didn’t understand C at all. This was all before STL so there was not difference
                        between C and C++ at the time. </p>
                    <p>I am glad that this clicked when it did. I was wondering why I started to learn programming at all. I didn't go into programming because I wanted to make games at first. I figured I better learn programming because I was dyslexic.
                        I need to use grammar checkers and spell checkers well. Maybe even I need to write my own AI things to automate things so I keep up. Without getting good at computers I would not be able to write science papers or whatever would
                        become my real job. These computer things would be big but I didn't seem to learn them very quickly. I was no hacker like on movies or something. </p>
                    <p>Even after coding clicked and I was feeling like oh I can do this. I was not sure I wanted to. I liked video games but I didn't want to write excel or accounting apps. So I really only applied at Radical Entertainment and Electronic
                        Arts (EA). After some time, I got lucky and got a QA position at EA. Then I got lucky again and got a programming job at Radical. </p>
                    <p>I think that will give you an idea of who I am. While I am senior software engineering at EA now and I love programming. It was a long journey to get there. </p>
